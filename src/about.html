        <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
        <p>After completing his Diploma in Special Education in 2002, Anil started working for an NGO in Agra as a special educator. During one of his visits to a clinic, he came across a mother and her baby who had a disability. Her husband was threatening to leave her because of the baby’s condition and she was absolutely helpless. Anil knew he had to do something - he took the baby in and that was the beginning of his incredible journey of giving children with physical and mental disabilities a better life. 
        </p>
<p>
            In 2005, he started the Integrated Institute of Rehabilitation for the Disabled and built a shelter home called Ashray in Agra. Today, he looks after over 72 children.

            “Some children are left here by their families, some don’t have families at all. There are some children who often remember that they have been left here by their parents, and while they don’t cry, they keep saying that their parents or siblings will come to visit them soon. Unfortunately, most of them don’t come - they don’t want to take responsibility for them.” </p>

        <p>Every year, Ashray hosts its Annual Day program, a day filled with joy, laughter, and celebration.

        <p> At Ashray, we firmly believe that every child is a unique and precious gift. We recognize that each child possesses distinct needs, talents, and aspirations. Our unwavering conviction is that these differences do not make them a burden but rather a source of inspiration and growth.</p>

        <h2> A Heartbreaking Reality </h2>
        <p>Regrettably, many children born with physical and mental disabilities face a heart-wrenching reality. Misconceptions and societal pressures often lead to their abandonment by their own families, who may deem them too challenging to care for. It is important to acknowledge that it is never the child's fault.</p>
